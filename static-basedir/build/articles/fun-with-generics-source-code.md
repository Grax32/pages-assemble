<html><body><p>Last night I gave a presentation about C# generics to the Lincoln .NET user's group.  If you were there and want to see the code or if you weren't there and just want to see some interesting generic code, check out this source code.  You will want to start by looking at the unit tests project, as that is where I ran all of the demonstrations from.<br />
<br />
My code from last night's presentation is at <a href="http://sdrv.ms/11ESMSs">http://sdrv.ms/11ESMSs</a>.  This is a Visual Studio 2012 project.<br />
<br />
<br />
For those of you that need a Visual Studio 2010 version of the generics sample code, this is from my Nebraska Code Camp presentation.  It doesn't have a few of the things from my Lincoln .NET user's group presentation but hopefully still interesting. You can download the Visual Studio 2010 project from <a href="http://sdrv.ms/15hAXYZ">http://sdrv.ms/15hAXYZ</a><br /></p>
