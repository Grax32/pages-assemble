<html><body><p>Here is the code the goes along with my January 25 presentation titled &quot;Augmented Reality with the Kinect&quot; at the Lincoln .NET Users Group.</p>
<p>Remember to check the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/">Kinect for Windows</a> site to verify you have all of the system requirements.</p>
<p>To get started with basic Kinect for Windows coding, I recommend Microsoft's Skeleton Sample.</p>
<p>The Kinect with WPF (Video Magic WPF) sample code from my presentation is available for download at <a href="http://graxark.codeplex.com/releases/view/81378">http://graxark.codeplex.com/releases/view/81378</a>.</p>
<p>The Kinect with XNA sample code will be posted soon.  I am doing a bit of cleanup to remove unused code and such before posting.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask questions.  I will answer them if I can.</p>
