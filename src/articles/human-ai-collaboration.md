As AI takes on a bigger role in software development, writing clean, understandable code isn’t just about helping other humans anymore — it’s about helping your **AI collaborators** do their job, too.

Whether you’re using AI to generate, debug, refactor, or review, clarity in your code affects the quality of its output. Think of it like pair programming: the clearer your intent, the better your AI partner performs.

## A Shared Vocabulary: 8 Function Types

One way to stay clear is to think in **function roles**. These aren’t language-specific — they’re purpose-specific. Here are 8 function types that help both humans and AI follow your logic:

- **Orchestrators** – coordinate calls to other functions  
- **Transformers** – take input, return modified output  
- **Filters / Predicates** – return `true` or `false`  
- **Selectors / Extractors** – pull data from structures  
- **Adapters** – reshape data or bridge formats  
- **Effectors** – perform side effects like saving or logging  
- **Reducers** – combine multiple items into one  
- **Initializers** – create default or base structures  

Labeling your functions by their role (in both name and behavior) gives AI models semantic clues — the same way a human developer would scan for `ValidateCustomer`, `SaveOrder`, or `BuildResponse`.

## Write Code That Explains Itself

Some simple habits make your code easier for models to understand and modify:

- Use **descriptive names** over abbreviations  
- Add **docstrings** that state *why* a function exists  
- Separate **pure logic** from side effects  
- Break down long functions into smaller, named pieces  
- Keep a consistent **naming and structure style**

## Example: Human + AI-Friendly Function Roles in C#

```csharp
public class OrderProcessor
{
    public Receipt ProcessOrder(Order order) // Orchestrator
    {
        if (!IsValidOrder(order))             // Filter
            throw new InvalidOrderException();

        var normalized = NormalizeOrder(order); // Transformer
        var total = CalculateTotal(normalized); // Reducer
        var receipt = BuildReceipt(normalized, total); // Initializer

        SaveToDatabase(receipt);              // Effector
        return receipt;
    }

    private bool IsValidOrder(Order order) => order.Items.Any();

    private Order NormalizeOrder(Order order) =>
        new Order { Items = order.Items, Customer = order.Customer.Trim() };

    private decimal CalculateTotal(Order order) =>
        order.Items.Sum(item => item.Price * item.Quantity);

    private Receipt BuildReceipt(Order order, decimal total) =>
        new Receipt { Customer = order.Customer, Total = total };

    private void SaveToDatabase(Receipt receipt) =>
        _repository.Insert(receipt);
}
```
